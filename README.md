# ADVANCED TOPICS IN PROGRAMMING (or PROGRAM DESIGN)

In my 7th semester I start the course on advanced topics in programming. 
Here in this discipline we will work with object-oriented orientation and train other ways of thinking about programming. Focus:

-> Object Orientation: (OO);
-> Android Programming (with JAVA)
